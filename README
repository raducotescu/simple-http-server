Simple HTTP Server is a basic multi-threaded web server implemented in Java. Currently the server only supports the GET, POST and HEAD
methods.

To run the server, simply issue the following command:

    java -jar simple-http-server-0.0.1.jar

This will make the server to use its default settings - more about this on the following lines. In case you want to provide custom settings,
launch the server with:

    java -jar simple-http-server-0.0.1.jar <path_to_configuration_file>
    

The available configuration parameters, along with their default values are:

    server.listen.port=8080
        -- the port on which the server listens (on *nix systems if you want to use a port lower than 1024 you must use sudo)
    server.listen.address=0.0.0.0
        -- the IP address on which the server will listen
    server.root.folder=./www/
        -- the root folder from where the content will be served; default this is a relative directory to the folder from which the server
        is launched
    server.default.documents=index.html
        -- (OPTIONAL) default documents that will be served if they exist and the request is made to the folder where these files reside
    server.browseable.directories=true
        -- (OPTIONAL) enables directory browsing
    server.threads.min=5
        -- the minimum number of threads to use for serving requests (the threads will be ramped up by the requests)
    server.threads.max=10
        -- the maximum number of threads to use for replying (this is equal to the maximum number of simultaneous clients)
    server.threads.keepalive=60
        -- how long (in seconds) should a thread be kept in the pool if the thread is inactive
    server.threads.queued.requests=10
        -- the size of the requests' queue; requests are queued if the number of simultaneous clients is bigger than server.threads.max
    server.status=true
        -- (OPTIONAL) allows accessing server status information by retrieving the /server-status page
